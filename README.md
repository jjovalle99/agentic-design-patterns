# Hands On: Agentic Reasoning Design Patterns

![Alt](assets/front.png)

## What is in this project?
This project is inspired by the recent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sal78ACtGTc) from Sequoia Capital, where Andrew Ng discussed four Agentic Reasoning Design Patterns. The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on approach by building simple examples that represent each of the patterns mentioned in the video.
